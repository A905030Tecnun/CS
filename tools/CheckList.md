# Points to verify when there are problems with a program:

- [ ] The program compiles.
- [ ] The program executes without errors.
- [ ] Verify that the source code an the excutable is the same (introduce a trace, example: ```System.out.println("Prog 1");``` 
- [ ] Introduce a trace to verify the most important variable, example: ```System.out.println("i: " + i);``` 
- [ ] Introduce a trace to verify the next most important variable, example: ```System.out.println("j: " + j);``` 
- [ ] Repeat the previous step for all important variables 
- [ ] Introduce a trace to verify that the program goes through the middle of the code, example: ```System.out.println("Point A");``` 
- [ ] If the trace is printed, repeat for the next half of the code, if the trace is not printed, repeat for the previous half of the code
